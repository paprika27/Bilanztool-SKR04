## 📖 Usage Guide

### Step 1: Upload Your Ledger
1. Click the **"Datei wählen"** button on the welcome screen
2. Select your Excel file (SKR04 format, feel free to use Hauptbuch.xlsx as a template)
3. Wait for processing (typically <2 seconds)

### Step 2: Review the Balance Sheet
- **AKTIVA (Left)** and **PASSIVA (Right)** columns show your asset and liability structure
- Green badge shows "Bilanz ausgeglichen" (balanced) or displays the discrepancy amount
- Click any row to expand/collapse that section or view detailed accounts

### Step 3: Check the P&L Statement
- Switch to **GuV** tab to see revenue and expense breakdown
- Same expansion/collapse functionality for detailed drilling

### Step 4: Handle Unmatched Accounts
- If yellow warning box appears, accounts couldn't be auto-mapped and may thus be unbalanced
- Switch to **Kontenplan** tab to assign these accounts to proper categories or fix in your excel ledger (usually more likely)
- Changes to mapping immediately recalculate all reports

### Step 5: Export & Print
- Click **"Export / Druck"** to trigger browser print dialog
- Tables automatically expand for complete PDF export
- Optimized layout for A4 paper with sometimes proper page breaks

### Bonus: Journal View
- Switch to **Journal** tab to audit individual transactions
- Browse full ledger with dates, accounts, and amounts
- Shows first 500 transactions (full data available in source Excel)

## 📊 How It Works

### 1. **Excel Parsing** (`excelService.ts`)
- Extracts account master data and transaction journal from DATEV compatible Excel ledger
- Calculates running balances per account
- Handles German date formats and decimal conventions

### 2. **SKR04 Mapping** (`skr04Service.ts`)
- Maps parsed accounts to German SKR04 standard chart of accounts
- Categories: AKTIVA, PASSIVA, AUFWAND (expense), ERTRAG (revenue)
- Builds hierarchical reporting structure with totals
- Validates balance sheet equilibrium
- Supports custom user overrides via mapping tool

### 3. **Interactive UI** (React Components)
- Hierarchical table with state-managed expansion
- Drill-down from totals → subtotals → detail accounts → transactions
- Dynamic recalculation when mappings change
- Print mode forces all expansions for complete export

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
The app requires no environment configuration. All processing happens client-side.

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
Outputs optimized bundle to `dist/` directory. Ready to deploy to any static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc.).

### Preview Production Build
```bash
npm run preview
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Empty page on `npm run dev`** | Ensure `index.tsx` script tag is in `index.html` |
| **Excel won't upload** | File must be DATEV SKRIB04 format with standard column headers. Copy your data into the provided Hauptbuch.xlsx template and try with that. |
| **Bilanz not balanced** | Check yellow warning box for unassigned accounts; map them in Kontenplan tab or fix your ledger (more likely) |
| **Wrong account categories** | Use Kontenplan tab to override auto-mapping for specific accounts |
| **Print looks wrong** | Use "Export / Druck" button which properly expands all sections |
| **Sums seem weird** | Throw your ledger at a (private) LLM to see if it can help. |
